title: Understanding Strategy vs Tactics

If you watch chess videos on YouTube, at some time you will see the **strategy vs tactics** idea. For the longest time I did not understand this. I didn't even know what was different between them, until I got the intuition from listening to [Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity by Peter Attia](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61153739). I'll explain how I think about strategy vs tactics and how I use it to organize ideas in life and work.

I think you can understand strategy vs tactics if you know the difference between goals vs mechanics. Strategy is the ideas that lead you to the goal, while tactics are the ideas that lead you to an outcome through the understanding of mechanics. I think a good way to understand this is by thinking about how to eat ramen.

We can't think about the strategy vs tactics of eating ramen without first having a good goal. This is because we need a strategy to define a goal. So let's set our goal as to enjoy a bowl of ramen as best as we can. Then, we can think of some strategies to get to our goal. Maybe the strategy is to savior the ramen at it's tastiest. Maybe another strategy is to taste the individual aspects of the ramen. If we choose our strategy to be to taste a different flavor each bite, then we can form some tactics to accomplish this strategy.

But to form some tactics, we need to know the mechanics of ramen, or how ramen works. We know that there are different toppings on ramen, so we can choose a different topping in each bite to change up the flavor. We know that there are extra flavorings, like pepper or garlic, on the side of the table that we can use to change up the flavor. By knowing the mechanics of changing the flavor in ramen, we can create some tactics so we can fulfill our strategyâ€”to create a different flavor each bite. These tactics work great for our strategy, but would they work well if we had a different strategy?

If our strategy was to savior the ramen at it's tastiest, and we don't really like the flavor of garlic, then the tactics we have above to change up the flavor wouldn't really be the best. This gets at the core of the difference between strategy and tactics. Strategy will point us to a goal, and strategy will get is in a direction. We have to choose the correct tactics align with the strategy so we can move in the direction of our goal. In eating ramen, this might not be a big deal, but in other parts of life, it could mean everything.

I have worked in places where the strategy was good, but the tactics didn't work because the people didn't understand the mechanics behind the tactics. I have worked in places where people chose good tactics, but since there wasn't a strategy defined, we were just moving around in random directions. I think this is why it's important to understand the difference between the two.
